# 🚀 My MEARN Stack Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal learning repository where I document everything I learn while mastering the **MEARN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, React, and Node.js)!

---

## 📚 What is the MEARN Stack?

The MEARN stack is a powerful combination of technologies used to build full-stack web applications:

- **M**ongoDB – NoSQL Database
- **E**xpress.js – Backend Framework
- **A**ngular – Frontend Framework (optional in place of React)
- **R**eact – Frontend Library
- **N**ode.js – JavaScript Runtime for the Backend

---

## 📌 Why I'm Learning MEARN

- To become a Full Stack Developer
- To build real-world, scalable web applications
- To understand both frontend and backend development in JavaScript
- To get industry-ready for software development roles
